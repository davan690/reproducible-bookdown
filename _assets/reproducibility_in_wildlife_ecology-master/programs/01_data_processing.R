#' 
#' **Create and fill out a new column for "Why not reviewed"**
raw_data$Why.not.reviewed <- NA

#' Fill in with "NA-Was reviewed" for all reviewed studies:
raw_data$Why.not.reviewed[raw_data$Was.this.paper.reviewed..=="True"] <- "NA: Study was reviewed"
#' 
#' If unsuitable, add this information in:
raw_data$Why.not.reviewed[raw_data$Was.this.paper.reviewed..=="False, unsuitable for review"] <-

#' 
#' In two cases, a study was initially thought to be not reviewed but it was. One 
#' example of this was jwm027, where the author was slow to respond, but eventually
#' did send us data. This was classified incorrectly in Google form as "False, 
#' author never responded." I need to remove this specific data point.

#' In the second case, we had to send in a written proposal to a regulatory agency to get
#' the data. We thought that we would not get the proposal accepted, so we thought 
#' that we would be unable to review this project. But, in the end, the proposal was accepted and
#' we reviewed this study. I will need to remove the data point that incorrectly
#' files wsb038 as "False, for other reasons not stated above"
