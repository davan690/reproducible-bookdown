The key aspects I am interested in here is the consistency of model diagrams in invasive species modelling in NZ and globally... for example.....

# Summary {#summary}

Processing data from Google form Description: Takes raw csv file from the Google form and updates it for analysis.

```

Clear environment and set seed 

```{r}

#Load Data 
raw_data <- read.csv(file = "./data/google_form_data_raw.csv", stringsAsFactors = F, header = T) 
str(raw_data) 

```

Fill in missing data The question “Was this study reviewed?” was added after a few survey responses were filled in, so I will update those records with “TRUE” 

View responses to this column:

```{r}
table(raw_data$Was.this.paper.reviewed..) 
## ## ## 6 ## False, author declined to participate (e.g., private data, no time, etc) ## 10 ## False, author never responded ## 41 ## False, for other reasons not stated above ## 6 ## False, unsuitable for review ## 6 ## True ## 32 Replace “” with “True” raw_data$Was.this.paper.reviewed.. <- ifelse( test = raw_data$Was.this.paper.reviewed.. == "", yes = "True", no = raw_data$Was.this.paper.reviewed..) 
```

Double check that it worked 

```{r}
table(raw_data$Was.this.paper.reviewed..) 

## ## False, author declined to participate (e.g., private data, no time, etc) 
## 10 ## False, author never responded ## 41 ## False, for other reasons not stated above ## 6 ## False, unsuitable for review ## 6 ## True ## 38 Why weren't studies reviewed? Create and fill out a new column for “Why not reviewed” raw_data$Why.not.reviewed <- NA Fill in with “NA-Was reviewed” for all reviewed studies: 

raw_data$Why.not.reviewed[raw_data$Was.this.paper.reviewed..=="True"] <- "NA: Study was reviewed" 

# If unsuitable, add this information in: 
raw_data$Why.not.reviewed[raw_data$Was.this.paper.reviewed..=="False, unsuitable for review"] <- "Unsuitable for review" 
# If author never responded, add this information in:
raw_data$Why.not.reviewed[raw_data$Was.this.paper.reviewed..=="False, author never responded"] <- "No correspondence" 
# In two cases, a study was initially thought to be not reviewed but it was. One example of this was jwm027, where the author was slow to respond, but eventually did send us data. This was classified incorrectly in Google form as “False, author never responded.” I need to remove this specific data point. 
new_data <- raw_data[!(raw_data$Study.ID..e.g...wsb002.or.jwm040.. == "jwm027" & raw_data$Was.this.paper.reviewed.. == "False, author never responded"),] 
```
In the second case, we had to send in a written proposal to a regulatory agency to get the data. We thought that we would not get the proposal accepted, so we thought that we would be unable to review this project. But, in the end, the proposal was accepted and we reviewed this study. I will need to remove the data point that incorrectly files wsb038 as “False, for other reasons not stated above”

This is an extension of the manuscript I found on github a while back and now have more bookdown skills to add some more notes.

Future update checks can be done by checking the github reprository: `aaarchmiller/reproducibility_in_wildlife_ecology`


## Overview

Why is this important....

- SSM modelling issues (secrets thing...)
- errors in life history structures are common (paper now)
- reproducibility is very important (SCIENCE CRISIS)
- predator free nz 2050
  - community groups are given concepts not details.... CEO etc relationship?


A literature review....

- Hard to start
- But as a computational workflow it is valueable to build
- very small collection of key points....
  - figures of concepts
- To find out key words...
  - `diagrammR`



Survey...

- extend from paper here...
- already have draft suvery
- email and ask??



## Method

**Lit review**

- collect all literature
  - Using this collection of keywords
